# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Wed - June 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working my way through understanding JSON and HTTPREQUEST.

**Thoughts:** This was the hardest section for me to understand so far, since it's like nothing I've ever done.

### Day 2: Thurs - June 28, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Spent an hour working with a web-developer on parsing data from an API with nested values. Finally got my raw JSON data loaded via the httprequest and displayed on my news app. 

**Thoughts**: This was a huge accomplishment for me in terms of progress with this app.

### Day 3: Fri - June 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Successfully took the IGN API and Polygon API and parsed both sets of JSON into a news app.

**Thoughts** Although it's not necessarily displayed how I would like it with one source at top, and the other below, I know that I could technically resort it through Collections.sort or a for loop. So for now I'm going to call it a successful journey into data-parsing.

### Day 4: Sat - June 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Woke up before 5am with the newborn, and spent the time reading up on AsyncTasks and the power of background threading.

**Thoughts** Still trying to wrap my mind around the concept, but I can see how useful it is to have processes threaded in the background.

### Day 5: Sun - July 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time learning about ButterKnife and binding views without findViewById();.

**Thoughts** Not quite sure how I feel about it, because it's so different than what I'm used to, but I can see how it would be quite useful in the long run.

### Day 6: Mon - July 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time this morning putting together a quick demo app for setting up a RecyclerView with custom ViewHolder. Spent the rest of my morning working through the News App Pt. 2.

**Thoughts** Since I've spoken with so many different students with questions about the RecyclerView vs. ListView, I wanted to put something simple together to show how it could be utilized.

### Day 7: Tues - July 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working my way through swipe-gesture listeners and implementing them into my news app

**Thoughts** Wanted to make a programatic way to refresh the news feed without requiring a button or restarting the app

### Day 8: Wed - July 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Took the day off for the holiday, but spent some time helping a couple other students work through their isssues.

**Thoughts**

### Day 9: Thurs - July 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent my day working with Michele on getting Fragments and Intents working properly for her Tour Guide app. Even though it took a million attempts, I love this stuff!

**Thoughts**

### Day 10: Fri - July 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reading up on SharedPreferences and deciding how I can most thoroughly over-complicate my News App Pt.2

**Today's Secondary Progress**: Worked on the RecyclerView Demo, and built it up with additional resourcing for using within Fragments and sorting/searching the data returned in an ArrayList.

**Thoughts** Since I'm prone to going overboard on my designs lately, I figured why not continue that trend and see what I could accomplish with SharedPrefs.

----------

### Day 11: Sat - July 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Take *THAT* Shared Preferences! Spent 2 hours getting my logic squared away to validate the date formatting for my EditTextPreference so that I can allow users to search their own date range... News App Pt 2 is almost complete.

**Thoughts** It took a lot longer to figure out the date validation than I imagined it would, and it's still not what I would envision for my apps final version, since I'd prefer to have a date-picker ... but for what I have, I'm satisfied.

----------

### Day 12: Sun - July 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working through a UI revamp for the News App, because I was inspired by the gorgeous UI in yummywakame's apps thus far. Also trying to set up a hidden quick view for the filters in SharedPreferences.

**Thoughts** UI UI UI UI UI UI

----------

### Day 13: Mon - July 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Refactoring my entire News App Pt2, because I figured out how to implement a few new features: hidden menu layout for current filters, swapping app background based on filters .... also working on changing color scheme as well --- SOOOOOOO CLOSE!!!

**Thoughts** After posting my AM progress, I was able to submit my project for review and I'm just waiting to see if it passes the rubric.

----------

### Day 14: Tues - July 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working through Data Storage and getting prepped for the final project. Also put together a medium article about creating a custom class that creates/gets an ArrayList to use with RecyclerView.

**Thoughts** It helps that I already have a broad understanding of how a database works, but I still think this will be one of the hardest sections for me to understand.

----------

### Day 15: Wed - July 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Planning out my capstone project, and wondering how I'm ever going to achieve my own goals for this inventory app. Dream big or go home I guess

**Thoughts** Spent the morning in Figma going over what I wanted my Inventory App to look like

**Link(s) to work: ** 

----------

### Day 16: Thurs - July 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: SQL should stand for *S* o hard to stay *Q* uiet because this database is being *L* ame and not letting me add entries to the database even though it's identical to the demo app. Sigh, erase and rewrite.

**Thoughts** I was getting really frustrated that my SQL Db wasn't working and continued to crash my app. So I deleted what I had and started over.

----------

### Day 17: Fri - July 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started from scratch this morning and rewrote my inventory app. Got it working and submitted. Huzzah!!

**Thoughts** Felt good to get it up and running, and made it even better knowing that I'm starting to get a better understanding of how the SQLite database works on Android.

----------

### Day 18: Sat - July 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the logic for the Inventory App Pt2. One database file with 3(maybe 4) tables to pull and validate data at the time of data entry to authenticate that no duplicates are being entered into the inventory database. I'm going balls-to-the-wall on this capstone project and it will be one of the pivotal apps in my portfolio moving forward.

**Thoughts** Since my goal is to turn this app into something that I will ultimately use at my job, I want to make sure that it's efficient and scaleable moving forward.

### Day 19: Sun - July 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working through a new demo on the MediaPlayer functionality. Also spent a couple hours laying out screens for my inventory app

**Thoughts** Basic day, simple progress.

### Day 20: Mon - July 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the MediaPlayer logic and tried to understand the life cycle that the MediaPlayer object goes through as it transitions between states. Almost ready to unveil the new demo

**Thoughts** Nothing major, just lots of trial error through setting up the seekbar

----------

### Day 21: Tues - July 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 3 weeks into coding every day has helped me turn a corner in my thought process. I've always struggled with follow-through, so just saying to myself that I've coded every single day for 3 weeks is a huge boost to my self confidence and reminds me that I could potentially be a good Android Dev some day. Today I spent a couple hours reading through the official documentation for the MediaPlayer framework and how it can be  a service extension. Also worked on my MusicPlayer demo and started moving repeating functions to separate classes/methods to cut down on boilerplate code.

**Thoughts**

### Day 22: Wed - July 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked for a few hours on the MediaPlayer Demo and spent even more time working through the tutorial on Medium associated with it.

----------

### Day 23: Thurs - July 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent most of the day sourcing articles, tutorials, books, libraries, etc for the ABND Nanodegree program. Then spent a little time on finalizing my color scheme for the Inventory App.

**Thoughts**

----------

### Day 24: Fri - July 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Trudging through Content Providers as I envision what my capstone project will look like if I incorporate a cloud-stored database for multiple devices using my application... Dream Big Or Quit Soon

**Thoughts**

----------

### Day 25: Sat - July 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Purposely tried to stay offline for much of my coding time to see how much had been actually absorbed into accessible  knowledge. Attempted to go back through the necessary components of Project 6 as I prepare for my webinar on Saturday

**Thoughts** The nerves are starting to get to me as I want to make sure that I have a good showing on the live_feed.

----------

### Day 26: Sun - July 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Had a second day of offline work to test my own coding knowledge. I remember less than all of it, but more than I expected. It makes me feel like I'm progressing even though I've been away from education for 10+ years.

**Thoughts**

----------

### Day 27: Mon - July 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through added a 3rd screen to my capstone Inventory App, and although I'm pleased with the design... it took me longer than I would have liked to debug why the activity crashed with a binary inflation error... Finally realized that I was requesting too much memory and had to rewrite the design of the view

**Thoughts** Still not quite sure why I was getting an inflation error, except it always seemed to be when I had a ScrollView or a ListView object on screen

----------

### Day 28: Tues - July 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent today going through ContentProviders and attempting to wrap my mind on how to organize my providers for my capstone project when I want to utilize 3 different tables for data validation.
