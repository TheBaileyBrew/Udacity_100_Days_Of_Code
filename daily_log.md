# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Wed - June 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working my way through understanding JSON and HTTPREQUEST.

**Thoughts:** This was the hardest section for me to understand so far, since it's like nothing I've ever done.

### Day 2: Thurs - June 28, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Spent an hour working with a web-developer on parsing data from an API with nested values. Finally got my raw JSON data loaded via the httprequest and displayed on my news app. 

**Thoughts**: This was a huge accomplishment for me in terms of progress with this app.

### Day 3: Fri - June 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Successfully took the IGN API and Polygon API and parsed both sets of JSON into a news app.

**Thoughts** Although it's not necessarily displayed how I would like it with one source at top, and the other below, I know that I could technically resort it through Collections.sort or a for loop. So for now I'm going to call it a successful journey into data-parsing.

### Day 4: Sat - June 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Woke up before 5am with the newborn, and spent the time reading up on AsyncTasks and the power of background threading.

**Thoughts** Still trying to wrap my mind around the concept, but I can see how useful it is to have processes threaded in the background.

### Day 5: Sun - July 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time learning about ButterKnife and binding views without findViewById();.

**Thoughts** Not quite sure how I feel about it, because it's so different than what I'm used to, but I can see how it would be quite useful in the long run.

### Day 6: Mon - July 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time this morning putting together a quick demo app for setting up a RecyclerView with custom ViewHolder. Spent the rest of my morning working through the News App Pt. 2.

**Thoughts** Since I've spoken with so many different students with questions about the RecyclerView vs. ListView, I wanted to put something simple together to show how it could be utilized.

### Day 7: Tues - July 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working my way through swipe-gesture listeners and implementing them into my news app

**Thoughts** Wanted to make a programatic way to refresh the news feed without requiring a button or restarting the app

### Day 10: Fri - July 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reading up on SharedPreferences and deciding how I can most thoroughly over-complicate my News App Pt.2

**Today's Secondary Progress**: Worked on the RecyclerView Demo, and built it up with additional resourcing for using within Fragments and sorting/searching the data returned in an ArrayList.

**Thoughts** Since I'm prone to going overboard on my designs lately, I figured why not continue that trend and see what I could accomplish with SharedPrefs.

### Day 11: Sat - July 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Take *THAT* Shared Preferences! Spent 2 hours getting my logic squared away to validate the date formatting for my EditTextPreference so that I can allow users to search their own date range... News App Pt 2 is almost complete.

**Thoughts** It took a lot longer to figure out the date validation than I imagined it would, and it's still not what I would envision for my apps final version, since I'd prefer to have a date-picker ... but for what I have, I'm satisfied.

### Day 12: Sun - July 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working through a UI revamp for the News App, because I was inspired by the gorgeous UI in yummywakame's apps thus far. Also trying to set up a hidden quick view for the filters in SharedPreferences.

**Thoughts** UI UI UI UI UI UI

### Day 13: Mon - July 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Refactoring my entire News App Pt2, because I figured out how to implement a few new features: hidden menu layout for current filters, swapping app background based on filters .... also working on changing color scheme as well --- SOOOOOOO CLOSE!!!

**Thoughts** After posting my AM progress, I was able to submit my project for review and I'm just waiting to see if it passes the rubric.
